A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of deep learning algorithm specifically designed to process and analyze data with a grid-like topology, most notably images. Inspired by the human visual cortex, CNNs excel at automatically and efficiently extracting features from visual data. Unlike traditional neural networks, which can have a massive number of parameters for image processing, CNNs use a specialized architecture with convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.

The key to a CNN's power lies in its convolutional layers, which use small filters (or kernels) that slide over the input data. Each filter learns to detect a specific feature, like an edge, a curve, or a specific texture. This process creates a "feature map" that highlights where that feature is located in the image. Through multiple layers, the network learns a hierarchy of features, from simple shapes in the initial layers to more complex objects in deeper layers. This hierarchical learning and the use of shared parameters make CNNs highly effective for tasks like image classification, object detection, and facial recognition, which are crucial in applications like self-driving cars and medical imaging.
