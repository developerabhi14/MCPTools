The well-known "robodog" from Boston Dynamics is officially named Spot. This four-legged robot, a commercial product developed from years of research into quadruped locomotion, is designed for a variety of tasks in environments that might be dangerous or difficult for humans. Spot's main capabilities include navigating complex and uneven terrain, performing autonomous inspections, and carrying different payloads, such as cameras, sensors, or even a robotic arm.

Since its commercial release in 2019, Spot has been used in various industries, including construction, public safety, and energy, for tasks like monitoring progress, detecting anomalies, and gathering data in hazardous areas. The robot's agility and stability, along with its ability to self-right after a fall, have made it one of the most recognizable and advanced robots in the world.
