# MCPTools – MCP Client-Server Demo

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) using a Python client–server setup.  
It includes two tools:

- Calculator Tool – Perform basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide).  
- File Search Tool – Search for relevant documents in a folder using semantic/contextual similarity instead of exact keyword matching.
