The "Epstein list" is a term often used to refer to a series of documents associated with Jeffrey Epstein, a financier and convicted sex offender who died in jail in 2019. This "list" isn't a single, definitive document, but rather a collection of court records, flight logs, and address books that contain the names of his associates, employees, and, in some cases, alleged victims.

The names on these documents have drawn significant public interest due to Epstein's high-profile social circle, which included politicians, royalty, and celebrities. The public has often speculated that these individuals were involved in Epstein's crimes, although the presence of a name in the documents doesn't necessarily mean the person engaged in any wrongdoing. Many of the people mentioned were simply associates, employees, or individuals who had social or professional contact with him.

The Department of Justice has stated that no credible evidence has been found to support the existence of a single, blackmail-focused "client list" for sexual acts. However, the release of these files and the ongoing investigations have continued to shine a light on Epstein's extensive network and have brought to the forefront the names of individuals who interacted with him over the years.
