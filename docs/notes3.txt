The history of pyramids is most famously associated with ancient Egypt, where they served as elaborate tombs for pharaohs and their consorts. The earliest known pyramid is the Step Pyramid of Djoser at Saqqara, built around 2630 BCE. This structure was a revolutionary step in architecture, evolving from earlier, flat-topped mud-brick tombs called mastabas. The most iconic pyramids, the Great Pyramids of Giza, were constructed during the Fourth Dynasty (c. 2575â€“c. 2465 BCE) for the pharaohs Khufu, Khafre, and Menkaure. These incredible feats of engineering were built using massive stone blocks, which were quarried, transported, and lifted into place by a large workforce of skilled, paid laborers, not slaves as was once believed. While the exact methods of construction are still debated, theories involving ramps, levers, and a vast, organized workforce are widely accepted. The pyramids symbolize the belief in an afterlife and the pharaoh's journey to the heavens. While Egyptian pyramids are the most renowned, similar monumental structures were built by other ancient civilizations around the world, including in Mesopotamia, the Americas, and Southeast Asia.
