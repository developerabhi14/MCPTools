Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where an algorithm learns from a labeled dataset. This means that the training data includes both the input and the correct, desired output. The algorithm's goal is to learn the mapping from the input to the output so it can accurately predict the output for new, unseen data. Think of it like a student learning with a teacher: the student (the algorithm) is given a set of questions (the inputs) and the corresponding answers (the outputs). By studying these examples, the student learns the rules to solve new problems on their own. Supervised learning is commonly used for tasks like classification (e.g., categorizing an email as "spam" or "not spam") and regression (e.g., predicting a house's price based on its features).
